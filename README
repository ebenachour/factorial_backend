This is the code for the backend.

It is a simple fast API application

We have two entry points:
/search = called with a GET and allow us to have the values for a specific metric or an aggregation by time.
/metrics = called with a POST. It allows the user to add a metric from its frontend.


Datastore:
We decided to store the data in an Elasticsearch and to query from it.
To initialize the ES, We created a script into the folder init.
It is used to init the index and to put some data.

The structure is very simple :
metrics: {name, value, timestamp}

We choosed to use ES because when using metrics, we would like to have some avg and the use of ES is easy for this.

It is not the only technical choice that could be done.
We could use a timeserie Database like influx db for example, which is the case for prometheus / grafana. 


How to run?
For the dev, we use a docker image for the backend and a docker-compose to have the ES.
to run it we have to do 
docker-compose up.
